## Code Overview

This repository implements a hybrid simulation-analytical approach to model patient flow and evaluate ward performance in hospital settings.

- **`simulation.py`**  
  Implements an agent-based network simulation modeling the flow of patients throughout the hospital, from ward to ward.

- **`residual_graph_and_structural_hole.py`**  
  Analyzes the simulation output to identify bottlenecks and structural vulnerabilities in the hospital network.

- **`percolation_perturbation.py`**  
  Compares two simulation states (baseline vs perturbed) to evaluate ward performance changes using percolation dynamics.

- **`fitting_dist.py`**  
  Fits statistical distribution functions to each wardâ€™s service time data.

- **`serviceValidation.py`**  
  Validates the accuracy of fitted distributions against real-world ward behavior.
