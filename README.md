# A Hybrid Approach to Model Hospitals and Evaluate Wards' Performances

This repository contains the code and materials associated with the paper. The agent based network simulation model the behaviour of the whole hospital, structural hole and flow algorithms identify the warrds with common persistent bottlenecks, and percolation and perturbation analysis evaluate the wards' performances.

> **Note:** This research was conducted as part of my PhD studies at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

## Code Overview

This repository implements a hybrid simulation-analytical approach to model patient flow and evaluate ward performance in hospital settings.

- **`simulation.py`**  
  Implements an agent-based network simulation modeling the flow of patients throughout the hospital, from ward to ward.

- **`residual_graph_and_structural_hole.py`**  
  Analyzes the simulation output to identify bottlenecks and structural vulnerabilities in the hospital network.

- **`percolation_perturbation.py`**  
  Compares two simulation states (baseline vs perturbed) to evaluate ward performance changes using percolation dynamics.

- **`fitting_dist.py`**  
  Fits statistical distribution functions to each wardâ€™s service time data.

- **`serviceValidation.py`**  
  Validates the accuracy of fitted distributions against real-world ward behavior.
